## 🎯 What is CODM ProStats?

CODM ProStats is a high-performance, mobile-optimized gaming dashboard that brings a **console-grade experience to the browser**. Built for competitive Call of Duty: Mobile players, it consolidates everything in one immersive place — your rank, K/D, win stats, and camo grind progress — all wrapped in a glassmorphism UI with ambient audio and video backgrounds.

### The problem it solves

- Player stats are locked inside the game with no shareable showcase
- No existing tool tracks Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Damascus progress across all 141 weapons
- Generic stat trackers lack the immersive, game-native aesthetic competitive players expect

---

## ✨ Features

### 👤 Player Profile
- In-Game Name (IGN), UID, Clan, and total Likes display
- Mode streaks and current rank for **Multiplayer (MP)**, **Battle Royale (BR)**, and **DMZ**

### 📊 Mode-Specific Rank Stats
| Mode | Stats Tracked |
|------|--------------|
| Multiplayer (MP) | MVP, Games, Top 3, Kills, K/D Ratio, Avg. Accuracy |
| Battle Royale (BR) | MVP, Wins, Matches, Kills, Avg. Damage, Avg. Accuracy |
| DMZ | Matches, Exfil Rate, P/L Ratio, Total Assets, Kills, Contracts |

### 🔫 Weapon Category Grid
9 weapon categories, each with dedicated pages:
- Assault Rifles (AR) · Sniper Rifles (SR) · LMGs · SMGs
- Shotguns · Marksman Rifles (MR) · Pistols · Launchers · Melees

Each weapon card features:
- 6-stat grid (Damage, Fire Rate, Accuracy, Mobility, Range, Control) with mini progress bars
- Flip animation with sound effect to reveal camo progress
- Gold / Platinum / Diamond / Damascus toggle buttons

### 🎨 Animated Camo Progress
Shimmer-animated progress bars with glow effects for all 4 camo tiers across all 141 weapons, displayed both per-weapon and as an overall overview.

### 🎵 Immersive Experience
- Full-bleed video background on the hero section
- Toggleable ambient soundtrack with a floating mute/unmute button
- Card flip sound effects on weapon detail reveal

### 📱 Fully Responsive
- Mobile-first hamburger navigation
- Fluid weapon grids using CSS Grid with `auto-fit`
- Optimized for all screen sizes

## ⚡ Performance & PWA

CODM ProStats ships as a **Progressive Web App** with full offline support:

```js
// sw.js — Cache-first strategy
const CACHE_NAME = 'codm-prostats-v1';
const ASSETS = [
  '/', '/index.html', '/style.css', '/script.js',
  '/ar.html', /* ... all pages */
  '/Guns/', '/sounds/'
];

self.addEventListener('install', e => {
  e.waitUntil(caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(c => c.addAll(ASSETS)));
});
```

- Installable on Android and iOS via `manifest.json`
- All assets served from cache when offline
- Theme color `#0a0a0a` for native dark chrome

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

No build step, no npm install. Just clone and open.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codm-prostats.git

# Open in browser
cd codm-prostats
open index.html
```

Or serve locally for Service Worker support:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node (npx)
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

> **Note:** Service Workers require HTTPS or `localhost`. Opening `index.html` directly via `file://` will disable PWA features.
